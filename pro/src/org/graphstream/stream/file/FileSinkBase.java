/**
 * Base implementation for graph output to files.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * This class provides base services to write graphs into files using a specific
 * file format. It allows to create an output stream. By default a print stream
 * for easy text output, but binary files are possible.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * It handles completely the {@link #writeAll(Graph, OutputStream)},
 * {@link #writeAll(Graph, String)}, {@link #begin(OutputStream)},
 * {@link #begin(String)}, {@link #flush()} and {@link #end()} methods. You
 * should not have to modify or override these.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * In order to implement an output you have to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Eventually override {@link #createWriter(OutputStream)} or
 * {@link #createWriter(String)} to replace the default instance of PrintStream
 * created for you.</li>
 * <li>Implement the {@link #outputHeader()} method. This method is called at
 * start, before any graph event is sent to output. Use it to output the header
 * of your file.</li>
 * <li>Implement the {@link #outputEndOfFile()} method. This method is called at
 * the end of the output, just before closing the output stream. Use it to
 * output any terminating syntax for the file format you implement.</li>
 * <li>Implement all the methods of {@link org.graphstream.stream.Sink}. All
 * these methods will be called for each graph event and must export these
 * events to the file you are writing. You should use the {@link #output} field
 * to write to the file. This field has type {@link java.io.OutputStream} but by
 * default is of type {@link java.io.PrintStream}, as most of the file format
 * will be textual.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
